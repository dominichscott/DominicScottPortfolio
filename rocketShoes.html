                    <i>The Devil has Rocket Shoes?!</i> is a game about precision, where an even slightly wrong angle at the wrong speed can send you back to the start! Play as the devil, who 
                    after finding an unweildly pair of rocket shoes that fell down to the underworld, has found himself stuck on Earth! He must now use the very same tool to carefully navigate 
                    the treacherous road back to hell.<br><br>
                    This game was developed using Unreal Engine, with models from the Epic Games Store and Adobe Mixamo. Its standout features are its momentum and propulsion systems, as well as 
                    the tracked fuel gauge.
